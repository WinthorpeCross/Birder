        <h2>What's new and what's under development?</h2>

        <p><i>Birder</i> is a hobby project. I am one developer working on it in my spare time. I have lots of ideas for
            new features.
            <br>This page outlines some of the ideas and it also provides an update on the progress.
        </p>

        <p>I welcome your suggestions for new features and/or your thoughts on how to improveme the existing features.
            <br>Please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto: andrewstuartcross@gmx.com"
